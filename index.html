		<p>Hong kong is a small area home to 7.392 million people. It was created during the Qing Dynasty in China. However, it was over ruled by Britian for 100 years after a loss in 1842, allowing Hong kong to become the internatinal place it is now. On July 1 1997, Hong Kong became known as "One Country, Two Systems" when it was given back to China. To this day, Hong Kong holds unique government systems and way of life making the city a interesting one to say the least. </p>
