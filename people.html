		<p> Hong Kong people are known for the fast speed. They believe that success and keeping busy are closely connected. Hong Kong people do not like to beat around the bush and take pride in the western exposure. They are traditional but have adapted to enjoy western entertainment, cusine and culture as well. Not to mention the many businesses use Hong Kong as a central hub, making Hong Kong very internationally connected. Community is also greatly respected as Hong Kong people like to be connected with neighbours and those living in the same area, would know anything from children names to doctors they go to. Toursim is a very big industry in Hong Kong and seeing foreigns are very common. Never be afraid to approach a local for directions or even recommendations for places to vist! </p>
